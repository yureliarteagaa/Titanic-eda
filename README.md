### 🔍 Key Questions Explored  
- What factors affected passenger survival?  
- Did gender, age, or class influence outcomes?  
- What was the survival rate by group?

---

### 📊 Insights & Findings  
- Females had a much higher survival rate (74%) than males (18%)  
- 1st class passengers survived more often than those in 3rd class  
- Children had better survival chances than adults  
- Fare price also slightly correlated with survival odds
