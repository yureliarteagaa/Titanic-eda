# Titanic Exploratory Data Analysis

### 📌 Overview

---

This project analyzes the famous Titanic dataset to discover patterns and insights related to passengers who survived. The goal was to practice data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and basic data visualization using Python and Pandas.

### 🛠️ Tools & Libraries  
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)  
- Pandas   
- Titanic dataset (Kaggle)

---

### 🔍 Key Questions Explored  
- What factors affected passenger survival?  
- Did gender, age, or class influence outcomes?  
- What was the survival rate by group?

---

### 📊 Insights & Findings  
- Females had a much higher survival rate (74%) than males (18%)  
- 1st class passengers survived more often than those in 3rd class  
- Children had better survival chances than adults  
- Fare price also slightly correlated with survival odds  

> 📌 Visuals used: bar plots, histograms, heatmaps

### 📁 Files Included  
- `titanic_eda.ipynb` – Full analysis notebook  
- `charts/` – Key visualizations (e.g. survival by sex, class)  
- `dataset/` – Titanic data from Kaggle

---

### ✅ What I Practiced  
- Importing and cleaning real-world data  
- Working with `.groupby()`, `.value_counts()`, and filtering in Pandas  
- Creating visual insights from raw data  
- Writing a clear project summary
